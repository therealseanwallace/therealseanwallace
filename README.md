### 👋 About me

Hi! I'm Sean, a 40 year-old career-changer looking for my first job in software development. Previously, I have been working in Bid/Grant Writing for 7 years but I'm ready for a change of pace. I've also done some copywriting and marketing contracts for a couple of years but I didn't see that as my "thing" long term.

So here we are.

## 🛠️ I’m currently working on

A Reddit clone portfolio app. I'm making it using Next.JS. More to come soon...

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

Recently I've been focusing on learning Next.JS and its different ways of building/serving sites e.g. static vs. dynamic routes. I am LOVING Next.JS' dynamic routing and used it to make my [Audiophile project](https://github.com/therealseanwallace/audiophilefrontend).

Longer term, I want to learn:

- SQL and some kind of SQL database - maybe PostgreSQL?
- More about relational databases in general. 
- Another backend language - I'm thinking maybe PHP or C#. Advice is welcome.

## 🥲 I'm most proud of

My website [Just Education Tenders](https://justeducationtenders.co.uk). It's already generated several leads which led to work for bid-writing jobs AND helped me network with other devs 😊

TLDR:

The app displays UK Education tenders sourced from official sources and updated in near-real time.

- This full stack app comprises three main components

- An API crawler built in Node.JS and running 24/7 on an AWS Lightsail VM (hooray for three-month free trials!) The crawler filters out education tenders and processes them into an object containing only the info we need for the front end. It then saves the tenders to MongoDB using Mongoose.

- A Node.JS/Express app which presents a RESTful API with a single GET route which the client can use to get tenders from the database.

- A Next.JS frontend app hosted with Vercel.
