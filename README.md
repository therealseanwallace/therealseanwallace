### Hi there 👋

I'm Sean, a 40 year-old career-changer looking for my first job in software development.

## 🛠️ I’m currently working on

I wanted to push myself to make something that looked awesome, so I am doing one of the Frontend Mentor challenges, Audiophile. 

Here's my [repo](https://github.com/therealseanwallace/audiophilefrontend) and here's the [Next.JS app](https://audiophilefrontend.vercel.app/) hosted on Vercel. The current production version might be a little outdated - I made a bunch of project but that pesky linter is stopping it from building :D More to come very soon...

I thought about making it a fullstack app but my main objective here was to try to get better at css and Next.JS. And I've got other fullstack ideas I want to do, so this one is just here to look pretty 😍

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

Recently I've been focusing on learning Next.JS and its different ways of building/serving sites e.g. static vs. dynamic routes. I am LOVING Next.JS' dynamic routing and used it to make my [Audiophile project](https://github.com/therealseanwallace/audiophilefrontend).

After this one, I am going to dive back into another fullstack project.

Longer term, I want to learn:

- SQL and some kind of SQL database - maybe PostgreSQL?
- More about relational databases in general. 
- Another backend language - I'm thinking maybe PHP or C#. Advice is welcome.

## 🥲 I'm most proud of

My website [Just Education Tenders](https://justeducationtenders.co.uk). It's already generated several leads which led to work for bid-writing jobs AND helped me network with other devs 😊

TLDR:

Thes app displays UK Education tenders sourced from official sources and updated in near-real time.

- This full stack app comprises three main components

- An API crawler built in Node.JS and running 24/7 on an AWS Lightsail VM (hooray for three-month free trials!) The crawler filters out education tenders and processes them into an object containing only the info we need for the front end. It then saves the tenders to MongoDB using Mongoose.

- A Node.JS/Express app which presents a RESTful API with a single GET route which the client can use to get tenders from the database.

- A Next.JS frontend app hosted with Vercel.
